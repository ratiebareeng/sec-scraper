# Midnight
Codebase and Documentation for `Project Midnight`

## Project Midnight

Project Midnight (Midnight) will be a web application that allows [Immoderata](www.immoderata.com) to discover and review detailed information about any company in the United States. 

## Problem (why do we need this software?):

- Immoderata does not currently have a reliable and automated way to proactively source investment targets. This limits the Company’s opportunity set. 
- Immoderata does not have an automated way to reach out to prospective targets and investment opportunities.
- Immoderata does not have a streamlined and real-time way to share deal-flow among team members. This can lead to a delay in deal processing and, in some cases, cause the company to lose out on a deal. 

## Opportunity (Why should Immoderata care?):
- Project Midnight can streamline the typically arduous sourcing, research, and outreach processes - saving employees hours of time and increasing firm efficiency.
- Project Midnight can give the firm a competitive advantage by sourcing off-market (higher quality) opportunities and allowing the firm to move more quickly on opportunities.

## Key Insights & Validation:

### Insights
- Deal sourcing is one of the toughest parts of the investment process:
    - It is typically a manual and comes from two primary sources:
        - Personal Network - drawbacks include limited scope, network contagion (leading to crowded deals/higher prices)
            - Social capital concerns can lead to pressure to pursue bad deals
            - Deals are filtered through the bias of one’s network
            
    - Brokers/Intermediaries - this is typically a low-quality deal flow. The good deals are typically bid up because everybody can see them
    
- Inbound deal flow ebbs and flows, as it is typically dependent on one’s network, causing gaps in the funnel and missed opportunities

- Outbound research (deal sourcing) is inefficient as relevant data points are disparate, myriad, and difficult to access 

### Validation

- Technology-forward investment firms are already automation to help source deal flow. This allows companies to preempt rounds and build relationships with management teams faster.

## Proposed Product Strategy: 

### What aspects of Project Midnight are we focusing on? 

The engineering and functionality of the product.  Does the product do what we need it to do?

### Are there aspects we are not focusing on?

Although we want a clean UI, optimizing the UI (look) of the product does not matter as much as this will primarily be an internal tool. 

### Are there relevant assumptions or constraints?

#### Possible constraints include:
- Inability to source data in a cost-effective manner
- The absence of API for needed data and the inability to source an alternative
- General project cost (design, engineering, etc.)
- Application maintenance costs and capability (ongoing server cost, etc.)
